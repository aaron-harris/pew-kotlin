Programming Exercise Workbook for Kotlin

## Overview

This project is currently in the early stages of constructed, but it will contain my solutions to various programming
exercises, such as [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).  All
solutions here will use the Kotlin programming language (my preferred language as a professional developer); if I decide
to branch out to other languages, I'll create other "PEW" projects for those languages.

Even though this code is intended as a learning tool, I intend to construct my solutions (and other supporting code)
using the same techniques and practices I would apply to any professional project for an employer.  I don't generally
have the energy for this sort of extracurricular project while employed, so I anticipate that most development here will
happen when I'm unemployed, and being rigorous about my work both helps me keep my skills sharp and lets any prospective
employers see the kind of work they can expect from me.
